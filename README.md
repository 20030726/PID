# PID Control Project

This repository contains two MATLAB scripts that demonstrate the use of PID controllers in two different systems: a magnetic train and a water tank. The purpose of these scripts is to illustrate how PID control can be applied to achieve stable control in dynamic systems.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to showcase the application of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers in controlling the behavior of two different systems:
1. **Magnetic Train**: This script simulates the control of a magnetic levitation train.
2. **Water Tank**: This script demonstrates the control of a water tank system.

Each script uses MATLAB to simulate the system dynamics and the effectiveness of the PID control strategy in stabilizing the system.

## Files

- `magnetic_train.m`: This script simulates a magnetic levitation system where the goal is to maintain the levitation of a train using PID control.
- `water_tank.m`: This script models a water tank system where the water level is controlled using a PID controller.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Control System Toolbox (optional but recommended for more advanced simulations)
- [Environment Setup](Environment_setup.jpeg)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
